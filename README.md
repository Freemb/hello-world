# hello-world

Hi guys,

I have developed a passion for writing apps and git seems like a no brainer for streamlining the development process. Initially got my feet wet with vba a couple years ago and after accidentally developing a full blown CRM database system with a Microsoft Access front end, and MSSQL back end, I decided to rewrite the entire thing in C-sharp as well as getting Microsoft certified in SQL server 2016. As the veil lifted, it has become more enjoyable every day.
